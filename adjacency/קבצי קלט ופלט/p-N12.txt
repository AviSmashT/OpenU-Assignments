This program recevie a tree matrix. The matrix will be printed and then checks if there is a path from node u to node v.
The number of nodes in this tree is 12 (0-11). You need to insert 144 values (0 or 1).
Make sure there is space between the values. 
You can press enter after every value input or every line input of the matrix. 
Now please enter the matrix values:











     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11

To check if there is a path between node u to node v 
Please enter the value of u first and then the value of v
You can press enter after every input or insert the two values in the same line (make sure there is space between the values) 
To quit enter the values '-1' and -1'
